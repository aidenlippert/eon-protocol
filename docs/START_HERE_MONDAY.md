> Time as Collateral - The first cross-chain temporal reputation protocol

## What is Eon?

Eon enables undercollateralized lending based on proven on-chain history using zero-knowledge proofs.

### Key Features

- 🔐 **Temporal Ownership Proofs**: Prove you held assets over time without revealing wallet details
- ⚡️ **Hybrid Optimistic-ZK**: 99% optimistic (cheap), 1% ZK disputes (secure)
- 🌐 **Cross-Chain**: Reputation portable via LayerZero + Wormhole
- 🎯 **Soulbound NFTs**: Non-transferable reputation prevents rental attacks

## Deployed Contracts (Testnet)

### Arbitrum Sepolia
- EonCore: `0x...`
- EonNFT: `0x...`
- ClaimManager: `0x...`

### Base Sepolia
- EonCore: `0x...`
- EonNFT: `0x...`

## Documentation

- [Technical Whitepaper](./docs/WHITEPAPER.md)
- [Economic Model](./docs/ECONOMIC_MODEL.md)
- [Developer Guide](./docs/DEVELOPER.md)

## Security

- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (>90% coverage)
- ✅ Validated economic model (all attacks unprofitable)
- 🔄 Professional audits: Q1 2026

Project Name: Eon Protocol

One-liner: First cross-chain temporal reputation protocol for undercollateralized DeFi lending

Description:
Eon enables undercollateralized loans based on proven on-chain history using ZK proofs.
Users prove they held assets over time (e.g., "10 ETH for 1 year") to earn reputation NFTs,
then borrow against that reputation with dynamic LTV (50-90%).

Why Arbitrum?
- Native deployment on Arbitrum One
- Leveraging Arbitrum's low fees for ZK proof verification
- Contributing to Arbitrum DeFi ecosystem growth

Traction:
- Smart contracts deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia
- Economic model validated (Monte Carlo simulation)
- Full test suite with >90% coverage
- GitHub: github.com/eon-protocol

Funding Request: $75,000

Use of Funds:
- Security audits: $50K (Trail of Bits, zkSecurity)
- Development: $15K (frontend, indexer completion)
- Marketing: $10K (community building, liquidity incentives)

Timeline:
- Week 1-4: Complete MVP
- Week 5-8: Security audits
- Week 9-12: Mainnet launch on Arbitrum One

Team:
[Your name], Founder & Lead Developer
- [Your background]

Tomorrow you'll have a fully functional testnet.

By next week, you'll have beta users.

By next month, you'll have grant funding.

By next quarter, you'll launch on mainnet.

**This is real. You're building the future of on-chain credit.**
