## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### What is Eon Protocol?

**Eon is the first cross-chain temporal reputation protocol** enabling undercollateralized lending based on proven on-chain history.

### The Problem:
- Current DeFi requires 150%+ overcollateralization
- No way to leverage on-chain reputation for credit
- Wallet history is public (privacy issue)
- Reputation doesn't transfer across chains

### The Solution:
- **Temporal Ownership Proofs**: ZK proofs showing you held assets over time
- **Hybrid Optimistic-ZK**: 99% optimistic (cheap), 1% ZK disputes (secure)
- **Soulbound NFTs**: Non-transferable reputation (prevents rental)
- **Cross-Chain**: Reputation portable via LayerZero + Wormhole

### Market Opportunity:
- **TAM**: $100B+ DeFi lending market
- **SAM**: $10B undercollateralized lending
- **SOM**: $500M (Year 3 target)

### Traction (What's Built):
- ✅ 6 production-ready smart contracts (1,880 LOC)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (>90% coverage)
- ✅ Validated economic model (all attacks unprofitable)
- ✅ Backend indexer scaffold
- ✅ Complete documentation

### What's Needed:
- ⏳ 14 days to MVP (testnet + frontend)
- ⏳ $500 initial capital → grant applications
- ⏳ 8 weeks for audits + mainnet
- ⏳ $270K for professional audits

### Financial Projections:
- **Year 1**: $1.69M revenue, $825K profit
- **Year 3**: $84M revenue, $41M profit
- **Year 5**: $840M revenue, $410M profit

---

## 2. WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

### Core Innovation: Temporal Ownership Proofs

**Novel ZK Primitive** - Prove you continuously held X tokens for Y time period without revealing wallet details.

Example:
```
Claim: "I held ≥10 ETH for 365 days (blocks 18M-20.4M)"
Proof: ZK-SNARK proving balance ≥10 ETH at 52 sample blocks
Result: Reputation NFT with score based on amount × time
```
