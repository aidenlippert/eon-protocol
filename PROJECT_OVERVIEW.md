# 🌟 Eon Protocol - Complete Project Overview

## 🎯 **The Big Picture: What We're Building**

**Eon Protocol** is a **DeFi lending protocol that brings traditional credit scoring to blockchain**.

Think of it like this:
- Traditional banks: "You have a 750 credit score? Here's a mortgage with 80% LTV!"
- Current DeFi: "Want to borrow $100? Lock up $150 first!" (overcollateralized)
- **Eon Protocol**: "You have a 750 on-chain credit score? Borrow with just 75% collateral!" (undercollateralized)

---

## 🚀 **The Vision**

### Problem We're Solving
Current DeFi lending is **capital inefficient** - you must lock up MORE value than you borrow. This prevents DeFi from competing with traditional finance.

**Example:**
- Want to borrow $10,000 in current DeFi? Need to lock $15,000+ in collateral
- In traditional finance with good credit? Borrow $10,000 with $8,000 collateral (or less!)

### Our Solution
Build an **on-chain credit scoring system** that:
1. **Analyzes your wallet history** (transactions, DeFi activity, repayment history)
2. **Calculates a credit score** (300-850, like FICO)
3. **Unlocks better loan terms** based on reputation
4. **Enables undercollateralized loans** (50-90% LTV depending on score)

---

## 📊 **How Credit Scores Work**

We use a **FICO-inspired** 5-factor model:

### 1. Payment History (35% of score)
- ✅ Repaid loans on time → Higher score
- ❌ Liquidations → Lower score
- ⏰ Average health factor on positions

**Example:** If you've borrowed 10 times and repaid 10/10 on time = 100/100 points

### 2. Credit Utilization (30% of score)
- Keep borrowed amount < 30% of available credit
- Lower utilization = Higher score
- Track current, average, and peak utilization

**Example:** Borrow $3,000 with $10,000 limit = 30% utilization = Good!

### 3. Credit History Length (15% of score)
- Wallet age (older = better)
- First DeFi interaction date
- Experience in market

**Example:** 2-year-old wallet with 1 year of DeFi activity = Strong history

### 4. Credit Mix (10% of score)
- Diversity of protocols used (Aave, Compound, Uniswap, etc.)
- Variety of asset types (stablecoins, ETH, BTC, etc.)

**Example:** Used 5 different protocols + 3 asset types = Good mix

### 5. New Credit (10% of score)
- How many recent loans?
- Time between loan applications
- Hard inquiries

**Example:** 2 loans in last 30 days, spaced 15 days apart = Responsible

## 🏆 **Credit Tiers & Benefits**

| Tier | Score Range | Max LTV | Interest Rate | Grace Period |
|------|-------------|---------|---------------|--------------|
| 🥉 **Bronze** | 300-579 | 50% | 12% | 24h |
| 🥈 **Silver** | 580-669 | 65% | 10% | 48h |
| 🥇 **Gold** | 670-799 | 75% | 8% | 60h |
| 💎 **Platinum** | 800-850 | 90% | 6% | 72h |

**Real-World Example:**
- **Bronze user** wants to borrow $10,000
  - Needs $20,000 collateral (50% LTV)
  - Pays 12% APY
  - If price drops, has 24h to add collateral before liquidation

- **Platinum user** wants to borrow $10,000
  - Needs $11,111 collateral (90% LTV)
  - Pays 6% APY
  - Has 72h grace period before liquidation

## 🛡️ **Sybil Resistance System**

### The Problem
"What stops users from creating new wallets to reset bad credit scores?"

### Our Solution: Multi-Layer Defense

#### 1. Wallet Age Penalty (-100 points)
New wallets (<6 months) get penalized heavily
- Discourages fresh wallet creation

#### 2. No Verification Penalty (-150 points)
Users without KYC verification lose 150 points
- Can get **+100-150 bonus** by completing FREE Didit KYC

#### 3. Staking Bonus (+50 points)
Stake protocol tokens to signal commitment
- Economic cost to gaming system

#### 4. Wallet Bundling Bonus (+20 points)
Link multiple wallets to prove consolidated history
- Legitimate users benefit, sybils don't

#### 5. Cross-Chain Activity Bonus (+30 points)
Activity across multiple blockchains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.)
- Harder to fake than single-chain history

**Example Attack Prevention:**
- User has 450 credit score (Bronze tier)
- Creates new wallet hoping to get better score
- New wallet starts at: Base 300 - 100 (new) - 150 (no KYC) = **50 points** 🚫
- **Much worse than original!**

## 🧮 **Credit Score Calculation Flow**

### Step 1: User Connects Wallet
```
User clicks "Calculate My Score"
  ↓
Wallet connects (RainbowKit)
  ↓
Frontend gets wallet address: 0x1A...4FE3
```

### Step 2: Fetch On-Chain Data
```
comprehensive-analyzer.ts
  ↓
Query Arbitrum Sepolia for transactions
  ↓
Analyze:
  - Lending protocol interactions (Aave, etc.)
  - Token swaps and transfers
  - Wallet age from first transaction
  - Current DeFi positions
```

### Step 3: Calculate Score Components
```
real-credit-score.ts
  ↓
Payment History: 85/100 (8/10 loans repaid on time)
Credit Utilization: 75/100 (30% utilization)
History Length: 60/100 (1 year old wallet)
Credit Mix: 70/100 (4 protocols, 2 asset types)
New Credit: 90/100 (1 loan in 30 days)
  ↓
Weighted Average = 77.5/100
  ↓
Scale to 300-850: 300 + (77.5 × 5.5) = 726
```

### Step 4: Apply Sybil Adjustments
```
sybil-resistance.ts
  ↓
Base Score: 726
Wallet Age: -50 (6 months old)
No KYC: -150 (not verified)
Staking: +0 (no stake)
Bundling: +0 (no linked wallets)
  ↓
Final Score: 726 - 50 - 150 = 526 (Silver Tier)
```

### Step 5: Display Results
```
profile/page.tsx
  ↓
Show:
  - Final Score: 526 / 850
  - Tier: Silver
  - Max LTV: 65%
  - Interest Rate: 10%
  - Grace Period: 48h
  - Detailed Breakdown
  - Improvement Recommendations
```

## 🔄 **Data Storage Strategy**

### Current State (MVP)
```
📱 Client-Side Only
├── Calculate score in browser
├── Store in localStorage
├── No persistence across devices
└── No verification
```

### Recommended Architecture (Hybrid)
```
📱 Frontend
  ↓ (calculates score)
🖥️ Backend API
  ↓ (validates + stores)
🗄️ Supabase Database
  ↓ (caches scores)
⛓️ Smart Contract
  └ (stores merkle root for verification)
```

**Why Hybrid?**
- ✅ Fast reads from database
- ✅ Cheap (~$0.01 per update)
- ✅ Can upgrade algorithm easily
- ✅ Privacy (details off-chain, hash on-chain)
- ✅ Production ready in 2-3 weeks

**Cost:** $25/month for thousands of users

---

## 🎨 **Recent Improvements**

### 1. Fixed BigInt Serialization Error ✅
**Problem:** Blockchain returns `BigInt` values → can't save to localStorage → app crashes

**Solution:** Added custom `replacer` function to convert BigInt to strings before JSON serialization

```typescript
const replacer = (_key: string, value: unknown) => {
  if (typeof value === 'bigint') {
    return value.toString();
  }
  return value;
};
localStorage.setItem('score', JSON.stringify(data, replacer));
```

### 2. Professional Hero Section Redesign ✅
**Before:** Basic gradient, simple stats cards
**After:**
- Animated gradient backgrounds with blur effects
- Trust indicators (Audited, Non-Custodial, Instant Settlement)
- Enhanced stat cards with icons and hover effects
- Section badges for visual hierarchy
- Better typography and spacing
- Step-by-step "How It Works" with step badges
- Improved tier cards with structured data display
- Enhanced CTAs with shadows and animations

### 3. KYC Integration ✅
- Integrated Didit for FREE identity verification
- Server-side proxy to avoid CORS errors
- Opens verification in new window
- Polls for completion
- Adds +100-150 points to score when verified

### 4. Score Persistence ✅
- Saves scores to localStorage (per wallet address)
- Loads saved scores on page load
- Converts Date strings back to Date objects
- Saves linked wallets

## ❓ **FAQ**

**Q: Why not just use Aave or Compound?**
A: They require 133%+ collateral. We enable 50-90% based on credit score = much more capital efficient!

**Q: How do you prevent users from gaming the system?**
A: Multi-layer sybil resistance: wallet age penalties, KYC bonuses, staking, cross-chain activity, bundling.

**Q: What if someone defaults?**
A: Insurance fund covers shortfalls. Borrowers pay premiums based on risk tier.

**Q: Is the code open source?**
A: Yes! Frontend, backend, and contracts will be fully open source.

**Q: When mainnet?**
A: 6-8 weeks after backend + smart contracts are built and audited.

**Q: How accurate are the credit scores?**
A: We've modeled after FICO (70+ years of proven methodology) adapted for on-chain data. Will improve with more historical data.

**Q: Can I use this to borrow for real?**
A: Not yet - currently testnet only. Mainnet launch coming Q2 2025.
