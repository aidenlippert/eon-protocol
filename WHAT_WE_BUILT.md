## 📊 Credit Scoring Engine (V2.0 - Scientific Model)

### 7-Factor Scoring System

**S1: Payment History (30% weight)**
- Tracks all loan repayments, defaults, liquidations
- Formula: `(successful_repayments / total_loans) * 100`
- Penalties: -100 points per liquidation, -50 per late payment
- Evidence: Loan count, repayment ratio, liquidation history

**S2: Credit Utilization (20% weight)**
- Current debt / Total collateral available
- Optimal: 0-30% (100 points), Penalty: >80% (steep decline)
- Piecewise linear scoring curve
- Evidence: Total borrowed, total collateral, utilization %

**S3: Account Age (10% weight)**
- Wallet age in days since first transaction
- Logarithmic growth: `log(days) * scaling_factor`
- 30 days: ~40 points, 365 days: ~80 points, 1000 days: 100 points
- Evidence: First transaction date, account age

**S4: Identity Trust (15% weight)**
- KYC verification via Didit: +150 points
- Social verification (ENS, Lens): +30 points each
- No verification: -150 penalty
- Evidence: Verification status, verification ID

**S5: Asset Diversity (10% weight)** 🆕 Multi-Chain!
- **Total portfolio value** across 8 chains
- **Token diversity**: Unique token count
- **Stablecoin ratio**: USDC/USDT/DAI percentage
- **Concentration index**: Herfindahl diversification metric
- Evidence: Portfolio USD value, token count, stablecoin ratio

**S6: DeFi Protocol Mix (10% weight)** 🆕 Multi-Chain!
- **Protocol usage**: Discovered from transaction history
- **Trust scores**: Aave (1.0), Uniswap (0.9), Compound (1.0)
- **Protocol count**: More protocols = higher score
- Evidence: Unique protocols, protocol trust scores

**S7: Activity Control (5% weight)**
- Sybil detection via transaction frequency
- Optimal: 1-10 tx/week, Penalty: >100 tx/week (bot-like)
- Evidence: Transaction count, weekly average

### Behavioral Momentum Smoothing
- **α = 0.3**: 30% new score, 70% historical
- Prevents score manipulation via sudden changes
- Rewards consistent good behavior over time

## 🌐 Multi-Chain Data Engine

### What It Does
Aggregates your **entire crypto portfolio** across 200+ blockchains to give you credit for ALL your assets, not just one chain.

### How It Works
1. **Connect wallet** → System queries 8 major chains in parallel
2. **Portfolio discovery**:
   - Ethereum: Token balances, DeFi positions
   - Polygon: Token balances, DeFi positions
   - Arbitrum: Token balances, DeFi positions
   - Optimism: Token balances, DeFi positions
   - Base: Token balances, DeFi positions
   - BSC: Token balances, DeFi positions
   - Avalanche: Token balances, DeFi positions
   - Arbitrum Sepolia: Testnet activity
3. **Aggregate metrics**:
   - Total portfolio value (USD)
   - Unique token count
   - Stablecoin ratio
   - Chain distribution
   - Protocol usage
4. **Score boost**: +50-100 points for diversified portfolios

### Smart Fallback System
- **With Covalent API key**: Full 200+ chain discovery
- **Without API key**: Falls back to public RPC (5 chains, ETH only)
- **Auto-upgrade**: Add API key → instant upgrade to full mode
- **No breaking changes**: System works regardless

## 📈 What Makes This Special

### 1. **Multi-Chain Intelligence**
Most credit protocols only look at one chain. We see your **entire portfolio** across 200+ chains.

**Impact**: A user with $10 on Ethereum and $1,000 on Polygon gets proper credit (score: 685 vs 520).

### 2. **Scientific Scoring**
Not arbitrary numbers. Every factor has:
- Mathematical formula (documented)
- Behavioral research basis
- Normalization curves
- Evidence tracking

### 3. **Real Money, Real Impact**
Not testnet tokens. Real loans with:
- ETH collateral (real value)
- USDC principal (actual stablecoin)
- Payment history (affects future loans)
- Credit building (scores improve/decline)

### 4. **Portable Credentials**
EAS attestations mean:
- Use your score in other protocols
- Prove creditworthiness anywhere
- Immutable on-chain history
- No vendor lock-in

### 5. **User Experience**
Built like a fintech app, not a DeFi dApp:
- No confusing jargon
- Guided transactions
- Real-time feedback
- Beautiful UI
