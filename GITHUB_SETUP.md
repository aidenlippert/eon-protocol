## 🔧 Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: Via GitHub.com (Easiest)

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `eon-protocol`
   - **Description**: `Time as Collateral - The first cross-chain temporal reputation protocol`
   - **Visibility**: Public ✅
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
3. Click "Create repository"

### Option B: Via GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
gh repo create eon-protocol --public --source=/tmp/eon-protocol --remote=origin --push
```

---

## 🚀 Step 2: Push to GitHub

After creating the repo on GitHub.com, you'll see a page with instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /tmp/eon-protocol

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/eon-protocol.git

# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME`** with your actual GitHub username!

---

## ✅ Step 3: Verify Upload

Visit: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/eon-protocol`

You should see:
- ✅ README.md displaying on homepage
- ✅ 24 files
- ✅ contracts/ folder
- ✅ docs/ folder
- ✅ indexer/ folder

---

## 📝 Step 4: Add GitHub Topics

On your repo page:
1. Click "⚙️ Settings" (top right of your repo)
2. Scroll to "Topics"
3. Add these tags:
   - `defi`
   - `ethereum`
   - `arbitrum`
   - `zero-knowledge`
   - `zk-snarks`
   - `lending-protocol`
   - `blockchain`
   - `solidity`
   - `smart-contracts`
   - `cryptocurrency`

This helps people discover your project!

## 🔄 Future Updates

cd /tmp/eon-protocol

# Make your changes to files...

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

---

## 📂 Alternative: Access Files Locally

If you want to work on these files outside of `/tmp`:

```bash
# Copy to your home directory
cp -r /tmp/eon-protocol ~/eon-protocol

# Navigate there
cd ~/eon-protocol

# You can now edit files with your favorite editor
code .  # VS Code
nano README.md  # Nano editor
vim README.md   # Vim editor
```

---

## 🎯 What's Next (Monday)

Once on GitHub:

1. **Review [docs/START_HERE_MONDAY.md](docs/START_HERE_MONDAY.md)**
2. **Execute the rename** (Chronos → Eon in all files)
3. **Deploy to testnet** (Arbitrum Sepolia)
4. **Update GitHub** with renamed files

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied (publickey)"

You need to setup SSH keys or use HTTPS with token:

**HTTPS with Token (easier)**:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/eon-protocol.git
```

Get token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

**OR use SSH** (more secure):
1. Generate key: `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"`
2. Add to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys
3. Use SSH URL: `git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/eon-protocol.git`

### "Repository not found"

Make sure you:
1. Created the repo on GitHub.com
2. Used the correct username in the URL
3. Repo is named exactly `eon-protocol`
