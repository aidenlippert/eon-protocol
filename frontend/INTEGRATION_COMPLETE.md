```

## Smart Contract Interactions

### Read Operations
- `getScore(address)` - Get user's credit score
- `calculateHealthFactor(address, loanId)` - Get health factor
- `getUserLoanCount(address)` - Get total loans

### Write Operations
- `deposit(address asset, uint256 amount)` - Deposit collateral
- `borrow(address asset, uint256 amount)` - Borrow against collateral
- `repay(uint256 loanId, address asset, uint256 amount)` - Repay loan

## Known Limitations

1. **Credit Score Calculation**: Profile page uses off-chain Arbiscan API for comprehensive analysis
2. **MockUSDC**: Test token only, need to mint via contract interaction
3. **Health Factor**: Requires active loan to display (shows ∞ if no loans)
4. **Gas Estimation**: May fail if insufficient USDC balance or approval

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add transaction history table
2. Implement analytics charts
3. Add notification system for liquidation warnings
4. Create admin dashboard for pool management
5. Add multi-asset support beyond USDC
6. Implement governance token ($EON) integration
