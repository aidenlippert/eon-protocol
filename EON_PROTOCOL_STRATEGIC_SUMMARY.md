# Eon Protocol - Strategic Summary 2025
*Bringing Traditional Credit Scoring to DeFi*

## The Problem

Current DeFi lending is broken:
- **Capital Inefficient**: Need $150k collateral to borrow $100k (150% overcollateralization)
- **No Credit Incentives**: Good borrowers get the same terms as risky ones
- **Instant Liquidations**: No grace period, no second chances
- **Inaccessible**: Most people can't afford to lock up 150%+ collateral

**The Market**: $50B+ in DeFi lending TVL, but only 5-10% of users can access it efficiently.

## The Solution

**Eon Protocol**: The first fully on-chain credit scoring system that enables undercollateralized loans based on wallet reputation.

### How It Works

1. **Analyze On-Chain History**
   - Scan entire wallet transaction history across 5+ chains
   - Apply FICO-inspired 5-factor credit model
   - Calculate score: 300-850 (like traditional FICO)

2. **Get Better Loan Terms**
   - **Platinum (820+)**: Borrow $100k with $111k collateral (90% LTV)
   - **Gold (750+)**: Borrow $100k with $133k collateral (75% LTV)
   - **Silver (600+)**: Borrow $100k with $154k collateral (65% LTV)
   - **Bronze (450+)**: Borrow $100k with $200k collateral (50% LTV)

3. **Build Credit Over Time**
   - Repay loans on time ‚Üí score increases
   - Maintain low utilization ‚Üí score increases
   - Active DeFi history ‚Üí score increases
   - DAO participation ‚Üí score increases

### The Innovation

Unlike competitors (Spectral, Maple, Goldfinch), we are:

1. **‚úÖ Fully Permissionless**
   - No KYC, no manual approvals, no gatekeeping
   - Anyone with a wallet can get scored
   - Democratizing access to capital

2. **‚úÖ Truly Capital Efficient**
   - First protocol to offer 90% LTV for individuals
   - Good actors borrow $100k with $111k (vs $150k elsewhere)
   - Unlocks $10-20B in trapped capital

3. **‚úÖ Transparent & Predictable**
   - Open-source scoring algorithm
   - Users know exactly how to improve their score
   - No black-box credit decisions

4. **‚úÖ Sybil Resistant**
   - Can't game the system by creating new wallets
   - New wallets get -100 point penalty
   - Builds trust for liquidity providers

5. **‚úÖ Multi-Chain Infrastructure**
   - Launch on Arbitrum, expand to Optimism, Base, Polygon
   - Becomes credit layer for all of DeFi
   - Network effects as TVL scales

## Competitive Landscape

| Protocol | TVL | Undercollateralized | Credit Scoring | Permissionless | Multi-Chain |
|----------|-----|---------------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Aave** | $23.5B | ‚ùå (150%+) | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Compound** | $2.08B | ‚ùå (150%+) | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| **Spectral** | ~$10M | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | ‚úÖ Partial | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| **Maple** | ~$500M | ‚úÖ Institutional | ‚úÖ Off-chain | ‚ùå KYC | ‚ùå |

| **Eon Protocol** | $0* | ‚úÖ Retail | ‚úÖ Full on-chain | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

*Pre-launch, launching Q1 2025

**Our Moat**: Only protocol combining all five advantages (capital efficiency + permissionless + transparent + sybil-resistant + multi-chain).

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams

1. **Interest Rate Spread**: 1-2% (borrower pays 10%, LP gets 8.5%, protocol 1.5%)
2. **Origination Fees**: 0.5% on loan initiation
3. **Liquidation Penalties**: 5-10% (2% insurance, 2-8% protocol)
4. **Credit Oracle Fees**: 0.1% for external protocols using our scores

### Financial Projections

**Year 1 (Conservative)**:
- Average TVL: $10M
- Revenue: $126k

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Oracle Failure**
   - Dual-oracle system (Chainlink + optimistic)
   - 24/7 monitoring + fallback mechanisms

2. **Smart Contract Exploits**
   - 2 independent audits + ongoing bug bounty
   - Emergency pause + multisig recovery
   - Insurance fund covers up to 30% TVL

3. **Liquidation Failures**
   - Automated liquidation bots (3 providers)
   - Manual liquidation interface
   - Insurance fund backstop

### Economic Risks

1. **Insufficient Liquidity**
   - Dynamic interest rates (2% ‚Üí 66% at 95% utilization)
   - Protocol-owned liquidity (treasury)
   - Conservative LTV ratios

2. **Credit Model Inaccuracy**
   - Start conservative (75% max LTV)
   - Track default rates (target <2%)
   - Quarterly model recalibration

3. **Token Price Collapse**
   - Revenue in stables (not $EON)
   - Multiple revenue streams
   - 5% of revenue ‚Üí buyback & burn

### Regulatory Risks

1. **Token Classification**
   - Launch as "points" first (3 months)
   - Token utility-focused (governance + staking)
   - No US marketing (geo-block)

2. **Credit Scoring Regulations**
   - Fully on-chain + transparent
   - No single entity controls scores
   - No PII collection (permissionless)

## Why Now?

1. **DeFi Maturity**: $50B+ TVL, but capital efficiency is the next frontier
2. **Infrastructure Ready**: Chainlink oracles, ZK tech, multi-chain bridges all mature
3. **Market Demand**: Users want better LTV, LPs want higher yields (undercollateralized = premium)
4. **Regulatory Clarity**: On-chain credit scoring is permissionless + compliant
5. **Competitive Timing**: Spectral is early-stage, Maple is institutional-only, Aave has no credit layer

**The window is open. Time to execute.**
