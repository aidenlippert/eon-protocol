2. **Copy to home directory**
   ```bash
   cp -r /tmp/eon-protocol ~/eon-protocol
   ```

3. **Create a tarball backup**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   tar -czf eon-protocol-backup.tar.gz eon-protocol/
   # Move to safe location
   mv eon-protocol-backup.tar.gz ~/
   ```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Read this file** (you're doing it!)
2. ⬜ **Access the files** (try `cd /tmp/eon-protocol && ls`)
3. ⬜ **Push to GitHub** (follow GITHUB_SETUP.md)
4. ⬜ **Read START_HERE_MONDAY.md** (your Monday playbook)
5. ⬜ **Copy to permanent location** (`cp -r /tmp/eon-protocol ~/`)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "No such file or directory"

Make sure you're using the correct path:
```bash
# Check if it exists
ls /tmp/eon-protocol

# If not, maybe it's in your home directory
ls ~/eon-protocol
```

### "Permission denied"

```bash
# Check ownership
ls -la /tmp/eon-protocol

# If needed, take ownership
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /tmp/eon-protocol
```

### "Directory is empty"

The files are definitely there! Try:
```bash
# Show hidden files too
ls -la /tmp/eon-protocol

# Count files
find /tmp/eon-protocol -type f | wc -l
```

Should show 25+ files.

---

## ✅ Quick Check

Run this to verify everything is there:

```bash
cd /tmp/eon-protocol && echo "✅ Project directory exists" && \
ls README.md && echo "✅ README exists" && \
ls -d contracts && echo "✅ Contracts folder exists" && \
ls -d docs && echo "✅ Docs folder exists" && \
ls docs/START_HERE_MONDAY.md && echo "✅ Monday playbook exists" && \
echo "" && echo "🎉 ALL FILES PRESENT!"
```

---

## 🚀 You're All Set!

Your files are organized, version controlled, and ready to push to GitHub.
