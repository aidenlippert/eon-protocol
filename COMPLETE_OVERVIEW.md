# 🎯 What We've Built

## 1. 🧠 Advanced Credit Scoring System

### **7-Factor Scientific Model (S1-S7)**
The most comprehensive on-chain credit scoring system:

**S1: Payment History (30%)** - The Foundation
- Tracks all loan repayments across the protocol
- On-time payments boost score by +25 points
- Liquidations cause -50 point penalty
- Behavioral momentum smoothing (α=0.3) prevents score manipulation
- Formula: `(repaidLoans / totalLoans) * 0.3 + momentum_factor`

**S2: Credit Utilization (20%)** - Smart Borrowing
- Measures how much of your available credit you use
- Optimal: 30% utilization = 100 points
- Over-leveraged: 80%+ utilization = 20 points
- Tracks collateral value vs borrowed amount
- Herfindahl concentration index for portfolio diversity

**S3: Account Age (10%)** - Trust Through Time
- Rewards long-term blockchain presence
- 2+ years = 100 points, 6 months = 50 points
- Tracks wallet's first transaction timestamp
- Prevents Sybil attacks with wallet history

**S4: Identity Trust (15%)** - KYC + Verification
- **Didit KYC Integration**: +150 points for verified identity
- Government ID verification via iframe widget
- Prevents multiple wallets per person
- Stores credential hash on-chain (privacy-preserving)

**S5: Asset Diversity (10%)** - Multi-Chain Portfolio
- **Covalent API Integration**: Scans 200+ blockchains
- Discovers tokens, NFTs, DeFi positions automatically
- More diverse portfolio = higher score
- Supported chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Base, Optimism, BNB, Avalanche, Fantom

**S6: DeFi Protocol Mix (10%)** - Active Participation
- Tracks interactions with major protocols
- Uniswap, Aave, Compound, Curve detection
- More protocols used = higher trust score
- Smart contract interaction analysis

**S7: Activity Control (5%)** - Behavioral Analysis
- Detects suspicious wallet behavior
- Penalizes rapid dumps (-20 points)
- Rewards consistent activity patterns
- Anti-gaming mechanism

### **Score Calculation Engine**
```
Final Score = (S1 * 0.30) + (S2 * 0.20) + (S3 * 0.10) +
              (S4 * 0.15) + (S5 * 0.10) + (S6 * 0.10) + (S7 * 0.05)

Score Range: 0-1000 points
```

### **Credit Tiers**
- **Platinum (900-1000)**: Elite borrowers, 80% LTV, 5% APR
- **Gold (750-899)**: Great credit, 70% LTV, 7% APR
- **Silver (600-749)**: Good credit, 60% LTV, 10% APR
- **Bronze (0-599)**: Building credit, 50% LTV, 12% APR

# 🔄 How It All Works

## User Journey: First Loan

### 1. **Connect Wallet**
- User connects MetaMask/WalletConnect
- Frontend detects wallet address
- Checks if user exists in system

### 2. **Credit Score Calculation**
```
User connects → API fetches /api/score/[address]
  ↓
Multi-chain scan via Covalent (8 chains)
  ↓
Calculate 7 factors (S1-S7)
  ↓
Return score, tier, APR, max LTV
  ↓
Display in dashboard
```

### 3. **Optional: KYC Verification**
- User clicks "Verify Identity"
- Didit iframe opens
- User scans government ID
- Facial recognition match
- Webhook triggers: `/api/kyc/callback`
- Score updated: +150 points
- New tier assigned

### 4. **Borrow Flow**
```
User enters amount ($100) → BorrowModal opens
  ↓
API call: /api/borrow/estimate
  ↓
Calculate collateral needed based on tier
  ↓
Show: "Need 0.067 ETH collateral for $100 loan at 10% APR"
  ↓
User clicks "Borrow" → TransactionStepper
  ↓
Step 1: Approve WETH
Step 2: Deposit collateral
Step 3: Receive USDC
  ↓
Success! Loan active
```

### 5. **Loan Management**
- View active loan in Dashboard → My Loans
- Health factor displayed (green/yellow/red)
- Interest accrues daily
- Liquidation warnings if HF < 1.5

### 6. **Repayment**
```
User clicks "Repay Loan" → RepayModal opens
  ↓
API fetches current debt (principal + interest)
  ↓
Show: "$105.50 total (principal $100 + interest $5.50)"
  ↓
User confirms → Transaction sent
  ↓
Contract: vault.repay(loanId, amount)
  ↓
Collateral returned to user
Loan marked as repaid
Score updated: +25 points
