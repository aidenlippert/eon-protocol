## Tweet 1/7 (Hook)

🚀 EON PROTOCOL IS LIVE (Testnet)

The first undercollateralized lending protocol powered by on-chain reputation.

Prove you held ETH for X months → Earn credit score → Borrow with up to 90% LTV

✅ Live on Arbitrum Sepolia
✅ Full dApp ready
✅ First temporal reputation primitive

## Tweet 2/7 (The Problem)

Most DeFi is broken.

Want to borrow $1000? Lock up $1500 in collateral.

That's not borrowing. That's locking away capital you already own.

Traditional finance solved this decades ago: Credit scores.

We're bringing real credit to crypto.

---

## Tweet 3/7 (How It Works)

**How Eon Protocol works:**

1️⃣ **Prove Holdings**
Use archive nodes to prove "I held 10 ETH for 1 year"
→ No trust required, pure math

2️⃣ **Earn Reputation**
Get credit score (0-1000) based on:
- Duration held (longer = better)
- Balance size (more = better)

3️⃣ **Borrow More**
Higher score = higher LTV
Score 500 = 50% LTV
Score 1000 = 90% LTV

---

## Tweet 4/7 (Why It Matters)

**This unlocks REAL lending in DeFi.**

Traditional DeFi:
❌ 150% collateral requirement
❌ Capital inefficient
❌ Only whales can play

Eon Protocol:
✅ 50-90% collateral requirement
✅ Use capital efficiently
✅ Accessible to everyone

**Example:**
With 10 ETH, instead of borrowing 6.67 ETH, borrow up to 9 ETH.

That's 35% more capital unlocked.

## Tweet 5/7 (The Tech)

**How we make it trustless:**

🔐 **Temporal Ownership Proofs**
- Query archive nodes for historical balances
- Sample 52 weekly checkpoints per year
- Flash loan protection built-in

🛡️ **Economic Security**
- $600 challenger stake
- Lying costs more than it gains
- Validated via Monte Carlo simulation

⚡ **ZK-Ready**
- Testnet uses optimistic validation
- Mainnet adds Groth16 ZK proofs
- Fully trustless verification

---

## Tweet 6/7 (Beyond Lending)

**Temporal reputation is a NEW primitive.**

We're building for lending first, but this unlocks:

🗳️ **Governance**: Long-term holders get boosted voting
🎁 **Airdrops**: Reward diamond hands, not flippers
👤 **Identity**: Prove "Ethereum OG" status
🎯 **Loyalty**: Crypto brands reward true believers

We're not just building a lending protocol.

We're building the credit score layer for Web3.

## Tweet 7/7 (Call to Action)

**Want to be an OG?**

We're looking for 10 alpha testers to break the testnet.

Test it → Find bugs → Get OG NFT when we launch mainnet

## Engagement Tweets (Post Separately)

**After main thread:**

---

**Visual explainer:**
📊 Credit Score Breakdown:

500 points from DURATION:
- 6 months = 200 pts
- 1 year = 300 pts
- 3 years = 500 pts

500 points from BALANCE:
- 1 ETH = 100 pts
- 10 ETH = 200 pts
- 100 ETH = 300 pts

Total: 0-1000 score → 50-90% LTV

---

**Economic security:**
Why challengers catch fraud:

Stake to challenge: 0.2 ETH ($600)
Reward if right: 0.3 ETH ($900)
Expected profit: $898.5 (99.9% accuracy)

Attacking costs $600. Defending is free.

Math makes honesty profitable.

---

**Competitor comparison:**
DeFi Credit Protocols:

❌ ARCx: Shut down
❌ RociFi: No longer active
❌ Credora: Acquired (centralized)
✅ Eon: Fully decentralized, trustless

We're the only one still standing with real on-chain proofs.

---

**Technical deep dive:**
Temporal Ownership Proofs:

1. User claims: "I held 10 ETH for 1 year"
2. Indexer queries archive node at 52 random points
3. If ANY sample fails → Challenge
4. Challenger earns $900, user loses $600

Game theory makes lying unprofitable.

## Media Assets

**Screenshot the frontend:**
1. Homepage hero
2. Claim submission page with score preview
3. Profile page showing 750/1000 score

## Timing Strategy

**Best time to post:**
- Tuesday-Thursday
- 10am-2pm EST (US morning, EU afternoon)
- Avoid Friday/weekends (low crypto Twitter engagement)

**Follow-up engagement:**
- Reply to every comment in first 2 hours
- Retweet with "🧵 Thread on how temporal proofs work" if gets traction
- DM anyone who asks "how can I help?"

---

## Metrics to Track

After 24 hours:
- Impressions (aim for 10K+)
- Engagements (aim for 500+)
- Profile visits (aim for 200+)
- Discord joins (aim for 50+)
- Testnet users (aim for 10+)

**If thread flops (<1K impressions):**
- Repost next day at different time
- Add visual graphics
- Tag bigger accounts
- Post in DeFi Discord servers first to build initial engagement

---

## Reddit Cross-Post

**Post in:**
- r/ethdev
- r/ethereum
- r/CryptoCurrency (if allowed)

**Title:** "Built a DeFi lending protocol with on-chain credit scores (testnet live)"

**Body:** Short version of thread + link to testnet + GitHub
